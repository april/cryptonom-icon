# Cryptography iconography

Creating diagrams to describe cryptographic concepts is tough, but it doesn't have to be.  The cryptonom-icon project aims to provide a set of freely available icons and diagrams for use in whatever projects and presentations you might have.

All diagrams are created in [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/), exported to SVG, and then optimized with [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo).

These icons were original created for use in my [cryptography 101](https://marumari.github.io/crypto-presentation/#/) presentation, which contains many examples of their uses. An (extremely primitive) [gallery](https://marumari.github.io/cryptonom-icon/) of these images is available, for previewing the included icons.
